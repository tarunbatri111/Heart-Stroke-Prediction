# Heart-Stroke-Prediction
A heart stroke, also known as a stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), is a medical condition that occurs when there is a disruption in blood supply to a part of the brain, leading to the death of brain cells.
Introducing our Heart Stroke Prediction Project powered by Machine Learning. Harnessing the potential of AI, we're working to predict heart stroke risks with unmatched accuracy, saving lives through early detection.
 Join us in shaping the future of healthcare, where technology meets compassion.
